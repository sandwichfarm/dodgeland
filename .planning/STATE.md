# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-10-14)

**Core value:** Friends can join and play distinct, readable local modes without making solo play harder to start or changing its established mechanics.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — shared-local-session

## Current Position

Phase: 02 — Shared Local Session
Plan: 1 of 6
Status: Starting execution
Last activity: 2026-10-14 — Phase 01 verified 12/12; 21 exact comparisons plus 270 regressions pass. All four summaries are committed.

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 13% of currently planned plans

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 57.7 min for Plans 01-01 through 01-03 (Plan 01-04 duration not recorded)
- Recorded execution time: 173 min for Plans 01-01 through 01-03

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 4/4 | 173 min for first 3 plans | 57.7 min for first 3 plans |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01, 01-02, 01-03, 01-04
- Trend: Not established

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 1]: Preserve exact fixed-step solo behavior against immutable baseline `a310a81`; route only policy constants through typed rules.
- [Phase 2]: One session owns terrain, simulation time, RNG, pickup claims, and camera policy; player slots own movement, health, inventory, powers, and stats.
- [Phase 3]: Keep existing 100-block innate powers separate from personal 250-tile revival and Revival/Flare consumables.
- [Phase 3]: Actual death clears only that player's run inventory; revival restores the character, while disconnect ghosts retain inventory.
- [Phase 3]: Joining Survive Together from solo adopts the existing world/player state; setup cancel resumes unchanged solo.
- [Phase 5]: Keep four seats, Flow as existing Stroll, and a 500-tile/180-second Race as validated provisional settings pending product confirmation/playtest.

### Pending Todos

- Execute Phase 2 Plan 01: shared world/player ownership, live adoption, two-player tracer, and exact solo preservation.
- Phase 2 plans independently pass; reconcile live Phase 1 APIs and preserve per-seat call cues/cooldowns.
- Phase 3 UI contract and seven plans independently approved; execute only after verified Phase 2 with current API reconciliation.
- Relay UI/six plans and Race UI/seven plans independently approved; execution awaits their prior-phase gates.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 is verified. The original `a310a81` model/render oracle remains immutable throughout multiplayer extraction.
- NAP-GAMEPAD remains an authorized draft adapter; no native controller polling. Missing gamepad support must leave keyboard/pointer play available.
- Race fog tuning and the provisional seat/race defaults require later product confirmation, but no requested capability is deferred.
